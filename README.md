# Project 5 -- GETAWAY
For this project, we were given 15 tile prefabs and a procedurally generated maze script. Through exercises, we learned how to make a user-controlled player, how to use procedural generation, how to use materials and lights, and how to utilize nav mesh agents to make randomly moving enemies that can be destroyed.

We were then instructed to apply other concepts from previous projects (create menus, UI, a goal...) to increase the quality of the project and make it our own. 

## Implementation / Features you added
Built using Unity 2022.3.45f

One user-controlled player

A large, randomly-generated maze level for the player to navigate

A randomized number of enemies that can attack and hurt you

A randomized number of keys needed to be picked up

One randomly placed exit, that requires all keys in order to let you exit

UI that reports health left, keys obtained, and time left (score is displayed via current keys held)

5 used materials (wood, bricks, monster texture, button texture, and key texture) 

Multiple light sources, one placed on the player, and one on each key to illuminate them

A main menu screen, and an end-game screen that shows different text depending on death type, or if you succeeded

Sound effects for idle monster noise, player getting hurt, key pick-up, and enemy death

Music for both main menu, and game

A student-created key and exit model

An imported monster model

Imported fonts for UI

Imported background image for menus

A wake-up sequence when you press "start"
